# JavaScript_Final: Analyzing Philadelphia Crash Data

This is an application intended for the Philadelphia Department of Transportation (PennDOT) and public, since this type of crash analysis had never really been done in Philadelphia, at least with the results available to the public. We hope to see further analyses and visualizations with this data to help researchers and the public better understand why traffic fatalities are occurring. Hopefully, this will result in better safety campaigns, more informed drivers and better-designed roads with the ultimate goal of reducing traffic fatalities. You can download the crash data from OpenDataPhilly [here](https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/vehicular-crash-data).
